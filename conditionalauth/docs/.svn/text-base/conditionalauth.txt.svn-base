ConditionalAuth module
======================

The ConditionalAuth module provides a method for automatically switching
between authentication sources based on conditions. There is only one 
authentication module:

`conditionalAuth:ConditionalAuth`
: Authenticate the user against a conditional selected authentication source.


`conditionalAuth:ConditionalAuth`
---------------------------------

This module is useful if you have certain conditions that have to be 
met before a certain authentication source is available.

To create a ConditionalAuth authentication source, open
`config/authsources.php` in a text editor, and add an entry for the
authentication source:

    'default' => array(
        'conditionalAuth:ConditionalAuth',

        /*
         * The available authentication sources.
         * They must be defined in this authsources.php file.
         */
        'sources' => array(
            'x509' => function() { return !empty($_SERVER['SSL_CLIENT_CERT']); },
            'tiqrUserPass' => function() { return substr($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], 0, 10) == '192.168.0.'; },
            'tiqr' => null
        ),
    ),

    'x509' => array(
        ...
    ),
    
    'tiqrUserPass' => array(
        ...
    ),
    
    'tiqr' => array(
        ...
    )
    
You should update the name of this authentication source (`default`), and 
the authentication sources it references, to have a name which makes 
sense to your organization.

The ConditionalAuth authentication sources only has one option: the `sources`
option, and it is required. It is an array with the keys of other authentication 
sources defined in the `config/authsources.php` file and as value a callback
function that checks if a certain condition has been met, or null for the default
fallback rule. The order in this array is significant. Conditions will be validated
from top to bottom and the first source which condition callback returns true is
used.
